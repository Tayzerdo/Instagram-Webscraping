# Instagram-scraping-to-extract-information-from-the-last-posts

## The goal for this work is to extract information from my instagram personal account Tayzerdo and check if there is a parttern related to the time/day I post and related to the hashtags that I use.

### First of all, I used python with libraries to help me out to extract, manipulate and save the data into an excel file to export to Tableau for data visualization.

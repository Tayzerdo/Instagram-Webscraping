# Instagram-scraping-to-extract-information-from-the-last-posts

## The goal for this work is to extract information from my instagram personal account Tayzerdo and check if there is a parttern related to the time/day I post and related to the hashtags that I use.

### First of all, I used python with libraries to help me out to extract, manipulate and save the data into an excel file to export to Tableau for data visualization.


#### The library instascrape is the main component as allow us to retrieve the information regarding the posts. 

#### For this work the method was:

##### Retrieve the last 200 posts for each account.

##### Created some manual calculation to extract the:
Day of the week;
Part of the day that is divided into:
Night  From 00h until 6h;
Morning  From 6h until 12h;
Afternoon  From 12h until 18h;
Evening  From 18h until 00h.

##### Hashtag Ratio that is the number of likes per posts.

##### Hashtag Quantity that is the number of post in Instagram.
